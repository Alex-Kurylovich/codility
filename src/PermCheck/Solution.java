/*
A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.
A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.
For example, array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2
is a permutation, but array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.
The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.
Write a function:
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
that, given an array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.
For example, given array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2
the function should return 1.
Given array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
the function should return 0.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

class Solution {
    public int solution(int[] A) {
        // write your code in Java SE 8
        
        // to check "permutation"
        // the main idea is as follows:
        // 1. use set to remember which elements have appeared
        // 2. use "for loop" to check if all the elements from "1 to A.length" appeared
        // If all the elements have appeared, then "yes".
        // Otherwise, "no".

        }
        
        // if it contains all the elements (from "1 to A.length")
        // then, "yes"
        return 1;
